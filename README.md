# Decision Tree Project

This repository contains the code for a machine learning project that implements the ID3 algorithm to construct a decision tree. The decision tree is built based on the provided dataset and can be used for making predictions and classifications.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is stored in the file [3-dataset.csv](3-dataset.csv). It represents a simplified weather condition scenario with attributes such as Outlook, Temperature, Humidity, Wind, and the corresponding Answer indicating whether to play a particular game or activity (Yes or No). The dataset can be modified or expanded to suit specific requirements.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.

2. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the ZIP file.

3. Navigate to the project directory.

4. Install the required dependencies using the following command:
pip install pandas numpy

lua
Copy code

5. Run the Python script to execute the decision tree construction and print the tree:
python decision_tree.py

python
Copy code

6. The decision tree will be displayed in the console output.
